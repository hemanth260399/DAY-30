(1) In this task I created the DB model for zen class
(2) Data types used for the variable with INT,VARCHAR,TEXT,BOOL,DATE,TIME
(3) In this ER diagram user will connect to all the database it connect with classes,task,events and queries so its one to many relationship
(4) Mostly queries are connect with many database it connect with task,events,user so it is many to one relationship
(5) classes are linked with task because task are given in class so i have linked the class with task and user are mostly linked so we get data in the user
(6) This is basic model in future i definetly i will improve myself and i will learn mor in database
